### About

This [Blender](https://blender.org) add-on will compile all rendered frames from your animation into a very nice and configurable sprite sheet, that's usable for sprite-based video games and even in modern cool websites.
It can also generate animated gifs, allowing you to easily showcase and preview animations without needing to use any code at all, useful stuff.

It was originally developed for use in the amazing [Ancient Beast](https://AncientBeast.com) eSport game project but sharing is caring! ðŸŒŸ

### Requirements

This add-on requires that you have [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org) installed on your computer and the montage command is in your system path.
It also assumes that you're rendering a sequence of still frames. Video renders will not work for this.

### Installation

1. Go to `Edit` / `Preferences` / `Add-ons` and click `Install...`
2. Use the `File Browser` to find `spritify.py` on your hard drive
3. Double-click or select the file and click `Install Add on...`
4. Use the `Add-ons browser` to find and enable `Spritify` (from `Render` category)

### Usage

There is a Spritify panel in Render Properties where you configure some of the
attributes of the sprite sheet as well as enable or disable the ability to
automatically generate a sprite sheet each time an animation render completes.
